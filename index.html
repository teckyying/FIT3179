        <em>
        How happy are people today? Were people happier in the past? How satisfied with their lives are people in different countries? How do our living conditions affect our happiness? 
      </em>
      </p> 
      <p>
        These are difficult questions to answer, but they are questions that undoubtedly matter for each of us personally.  
        Every year the World Happiness Report surveys <strong>156 countries</strong> and ranks them according to how happy they are. This report is a 
        publication by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. <strong>The scores are instead based on individuals’ own assessments of their lives</strong>, 
        revealed by their answers to the Cantril ladder question that invites survey participants to imagine their current position on a ladder with
        steps numbered from 0 to 10, where the top represents the best possible and the bottom the
        worst possible life for themselves.

      Factors Affecting Happiness

<div class = 'subheader2_info'>
  <p>In this section we will present how six key variables contribute to explaining the national average happiness scores and higher life evaluations in the year 2019.
    These variables are Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption. 
  </p>
 
  <p>
    Note that we do not construct our happiness measure in each country using these six variables. Rather, We use the six
    variables to explain the variation of happiness across countries.

    The world is getting used to being told that Scandinavian countries are among the best places to live.
     The release of the 2019 World Happiness Report again confirms that impression with four Nordic countries in the top five happiest nations.


  </p>
  <p>
    Finland, which headed the table last year, came top again, followed by Denmark, Norway (top in 2017) and Iceland. 
The Netherlands joined them in the top five. Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Austria completed the top 10.
